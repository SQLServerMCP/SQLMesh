An SQLMesh project for a small banking system, with accounts, customers and transactional data. The SQLMesh project pulls data from Databricks tables in a Bronze layer loaded via COPY INTO commands in notebooks. It is transformed by SQLMesh and pushed into Databricks Silver and Gold layers, where it is used in Databricks notebooks, dashboards and Genie.
